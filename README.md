# Teach and Repeat Navigation

## Introduction

This Repo mainly collects information related to **Teach and Repeat Navigation**, including **traditional methods**, **latest work**, **video courses**, **application**, etc.

The **difference** between **Teach and Repeat Navigation** and **Path Following**: the path of Teach and Repeat Navigation must be the real past trajectory of the robot. Path Following is a more general problem, and the Path can be output by Teach or generated by the algorithm.

## Traditional Method

- 1.Pure Pursuit
- 2.MPC
